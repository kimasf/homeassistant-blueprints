# Home Assistant Presence Sensor Blueprint

## 📌 Overview
This blueprint automates lighting based on motion detection. It **saves the current state of all lights** in a room before turning them off and **restores the same lights** when motion is detected again.

🔹 **Main Features:**
- ✅ Works with **any motion sensor**
- ✅ **Saves the state of all lights** in the room
- ✅ **Restores the lights** when motion is detected
- ✅ Adjustable **delay before turning off** (seconds & minutes)
- ✅ **Easy setup** – No coding required!

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
To use this blueprint, you need:
- A **motion sensor** integrated with Home Assistant (e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave, WiFi PIR sensors)
- Smart lights or light switches that Home Assistant can control

## 📥 Quick Import to Home Assistant

[![Open in Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kimasf/homeassistant-blueprints/main/presence_sensor.yaml)

Alternatively, you can manually copy the YAML file to:
```bash
/config/blueprints/automation/YOUR_FOLDER/presence_sensor.yaml
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration
### **1️⃣ Create a New Automation**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Automations & Scenes** → **Blueprints**.
2. Select **Presence Sensor Blueprint**.
3. Click **Create Automation**.

### **2️⃣ Customize Your Settings**
- **Motion Sensor** → Select your motion sensor.
- **Lights to Control** → Choose the lights in your room.
- **Turn-Off Delay** → Set the delay before lights turn off (in seconds/minutes).
- **Scene Name** → (Optional) Customize the saved scene name.

---

## 🔄 How It Works
1. When motion is **detected**, the blueprint **restores the previous lights** in the room.
2. When no motion is detected for the set delay, it **saves the current light state** and **turns them off**.
3. The next time motion is detected, the **same lights** will turn back on!
